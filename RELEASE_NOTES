  Release Notes for version 2.0.2
===================================

UPGRADING
---------
Nothing special

CHANGES
-------
1) Fixed bug parsing Condor event codes 29 and 30
2) Improved install instructions.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) --wait still doesn't work

===================================
  Release Notes for version 2.0.1
===================================

UPGRADING
---------
Nothing special

CHANGES
-------
1) Change default port to 9443 to reduce conflicts with other services.
2) Add error messages and prevent users from running client and server as root.
3) Add support for GT5

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) --wait still doesn't work

===================================
  Release Notes for version 2.0.0
===================================

UPGRADING
---------
This release requires a database upgrade to remove some unnecessary tables. 
See the upgrade directory in SVN for more information.

CHANGES
-------
1) No longer based on Globus GT4 framework. Too many changes to list.
2) Added support for Condor parallel universe.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait command-line option still doesn't work correctly. I am going
   to fix it when I re-implement notifications.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.2.1
===================================

UPGRADING
---------
This release requires a database upgrade to add support for ccbAddress. 
See the upgrade directory in SVN for more information.

CHANGES
-------
1) Added support for the CCB feature added to Condor 7.3.x. Users can now
   specify a CCB broker using the -ccb command-line argument when creating
   glideins.
2) Added a new state for finished glideins. Now instead of being deleted when
   they are finished, glideins will enter the FINISHED state. From this state
   they can be manually removed, or they will be periodically removed by a
   reaper thread. This change will make debugging easier because the stdout,
   stderr, and submit scripts for the job won't be automatically deleted.
3) Aborted glideins are no longer automatically deleted. This fixes a bug
   where failed jobs are automatically aborted in certain Globus failure
   conditions when the job may be held. All aborted glideins are put into
   the FAILED state and are cleaned up periodically.
4) Added a reaper thread to periodically delete FAILED and FINISHED glideins.
5) Added the full condor log message to failure messages.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait command-line option still doesn't work correctly, and probably
   never will.

===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.2.0
===================================

UPGRADING
---------
This version requires Globus 4.2.x and is incompatible with the 4.0.x series.

CHANGES
-------
1) Modified the service to work with Globus 4.2. Unfortunately, this involved
   many changes all over the place and I didn't write them all down. Look in
   SVN in you want a complete diff.
2) Updated the web pages to say "Corral" instead of "Glidein Service".

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait command-line option still doesn't work correctly, and probably
   never will.

===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.7
===================================

UPGRADING
---------
This release requires a database upgrade to add support for lowport and 
highport. See the upgrade directory in SVN for more information.

CHANGES
-------
1)  Added condor_logstat to the tools. This tool monitors a Condor pool and
    periodically records statistics about the machines and jobs in the pool
    in a NetLogger-formatted log file.
2)  Fixed the annoying uninterruptible sleep issue in glidein_run. Now when
    you send a sigterm to glidein_run it immediately signals condor_master
    instead of waiting. Now it should quickly and cleanly shut down.
3)  Added support for setting the HIGHPORT and LOWPORT used by Condor. THIS
    CHANGE REQUIRES A DATABASE UPGRADE (See upgrade directory in SVN).
4)  Added CORRAL_SERVER, CORRAL_SITE_ID, CORRAL_SITE_NAME, and 
    CORRAL_GLIDEIN_ID to the environment of glidein jobs and CORRAL_SERVER, 
    CORRAL_SITE_ID and CORRAL_SITE_NAME to the environment of install and 
    uninstall jobs.
5)  Changed the default local-path to /tmp and the default install-path 
    to $HOME/.corral/$CORRAL_SERVER/$CORRAL_SITE_ID.
6)  Log the condor job ID for glidein jobs, install jobs, and uninstall jobs
    in the NetLogger log file.
7)  Added package_mapper to the tools. This is a web application that takes
    requests from glidein_install for packages that can't be found in RLS and
    maps them to the appropriate URL.
8)  Created a glidein_start script to wrap glidein_run. This will prevent 
    Globus from prematurely deleting the glidein_run script before it is 
    finished cleaning up.
9)  Fixed a bug in glidein_install that parsed the output of globus-rls-cli
    incorrectly for old versions of globus-rls-cli that don't separate the
    lfn and pfn with a ':' character.
10) glidein_uninstall no longer attempts to remove the LOCAL_PATH. It is
    assumed that LOCAL_PATH will either be cleaned up automatically, or
    will be located in a local file system that glidein_uninstall will not
    have access to anyway.
11) Glideins now advertise CorralSiteId, CorralGlideinId, CorralSiteName,
    and CorralServer.
12) Fix a bug where environment variables are not written correctly to the 
    Condor job script

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait command-line option still doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.6
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Error messages no longer gum up the output of list-site and list-glidein.
2) The glidein job has a better way of determining where the job directory
   is. Previously, it was relying on a shell variable that wasn't available on
   all sites.
3) The pegasus.isi.edu web pages for the glidein service are now included in
   this project.
4) The -rsl/--globus-rsl parameter now appends/replaces values in the RSL
   string instead of replacing the RSL string altogether. The advantage of
   this is that you no longer have to specify everything when you want to use
   a custom RSL parameter. The disadvantage is that you can't replace/omit
   parameters that are assumed by the glidein service (like count, hostCount
   and jobType).
5) The list-glidein command is now called list-glideins and the list-site
   command is now called list-sites.
6) The list-glideins and list-sites commands now accept -a/--all to show
   sites/glideins for all users, and -u/--user to list sites/glideins for a
   specific user. The default is to display sites/glideins for the current
   user only. The usernames are based on the server, not the client.
7) The service now produces a Netlogger-formatted log file. By default, the
   log is created in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/glidein_service/netlogger.log.
   The path can be changed by modifying the jndi-config.xml file.
8) There is now a GAR file for the glidein service client.
9) The glidein command allows the user to specify defaults for --host using
   the GLIDEIN_HOST environment variable and --port using the GLIDEIN_PORT
   environment variable.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait command-line option still doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.5
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) --local-path and --install-path now have reasonable defaults. They are also
   now allowed to contain shell variables which are expanded on the remote
   host. So you can say you want --install-path to be $SCRATCH/username/glidein
   and "$SCRATCH" will be evaluated on the remote side.
2) The glidein job detects when the job directory disappears and kills Condor
   on sites that don't send signals to the user's jobs on all nodes (e.g. 
   skynet). This ensures that if the user kills the glidein job, then the
   glideins will actually go away.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait command-line option still doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.4
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Exclude interfaces with private IP addresses in 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255.
2) Use the site name as the UID_DOMAIN and FILE_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait option still doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.3
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Also delete localPath when removing site.
2) Add timestamp to history command output.
3) Glidein job identifies usable IP address from output of /sbin/ifconfig. It
   prefers public IPs over private IPs, but it will use private IPs if no
   public IP is available (needed for HPCC glideins).
4) Application jobs running on the glidein inherit the environment variables
   of the remote site. This enables the application job to access variables
   like $X509_USER_PROXY and $SCRATCH and $GLOBUS_LOCATION.
5) Allow --condor-package to be a logical name, URL (http[s], ftp, gsiftp), 
   or absolute file name.
6) Avoid using globus-url-copy or globus-rls-cli on the remote side unless
   they are really needed. This allows users to specify URLs or file names
   for the Condor package when the remote site doesn't have Globus installed.
7) Add --wait option for create-site and create-glidein. This allows the
   command-line utility to block until the site/glidein reaches a success
   or failed state. This makes scripting the command-line interface easier.
   
KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait option doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.2
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Implement notifications. Notifications allow asynchronous updates of
   glidein and site state to be sent to clients.
2) Binary worker packages can now be discovered by looking up the package
   name in RLS. The RLS server to use is defined in the jndi.xml file for
   the service.
3) The service will store the EPR for the user's credential instead of the
   credential itself so that the user can update their credential and the
   service will automatically use the new one.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
NONE


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.1
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Logical package names should have ".tar.gz" on the end now.
2) Fixed errors when determining host name on remote workers.
3) Normalize all the parameter names across all config files and command-line
   options.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
NONE


===================================
