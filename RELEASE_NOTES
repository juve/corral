===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.6
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Error messages no longer gum up the output of list-site and list-glidein.
2) The glidein job has a better way of determining where the job directory
   is. Previously, it was relying on a shell variable that wasn't available on
   all sites.
3) The pegasus.isi.edu web pages for the glidein service are now included in
   this project.
4) The -rsl/--globus-rsl parameter now appends/replaces values in the RSL
   string instead of replacing the RSL string altogether. The advantage of
   this is that you no longer have to specify everything when you want to use
   a custom RSL parameter. The disadvantage is that you can't replace/omit
   parameters that are assumed by the glidein service (like count, hostCount
   and jobType).
5) The list-glidein command is now called list-glideins and the list-site
   command is now called list-sites.
6) The list-glideins and list-sites commands now accept -a/--all to show
   sites/glideins for all users, and -u/--user to list sites/glideins for a
   specific user. The default is to display sites/glideins for the current
   user only. The usernames are based on the server, not the client.
7) The service now produces a Netlogger-formatted log file. By default, the
   log is created in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/glidein_service/netlogger.log.
   The path can be changed by modifying the jndi-config.xml file.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait command-line option still doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.5
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) --local-path and --install-path now have reasonable defaults. They are also
   now allowed to contain shell variables which are expanded on the remote
   host. So you can say you want --install-path to be $SCRATCH/username/glidein
   and "$SCRATCH" will be evaluated on the remote side.
2) The glidein job detects when the job directory disappears and kills Condor
   on sites that don't send signals to the user's jobs on all nodes (e.g. 
   skynet). This ensures that if the user kills the glidein job, then the
   glideins will actually go away.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait command-line option still doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.4
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Exclude interfaces with private IP addresses in 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255.
2) Use the site name as the UID_DOMAIN and FILE_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait option still doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.3
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Also delete localPath when removing site.
2) Add timestamp to history command output.
3) Glidein job identifies usable IP address from output of /sbin/ifconfig. It
   prefers public IPs over private IPs, but it will use private IPs if no
   public IP is available (needed for HPCC glideins).
4) Application jobs running on the glidein inherit the environment variables
   of the remote site. This enables the application job to access variables
   like $X509_USER_PROXY and $SCRATCH and $GLOBUS_LOCATION.
5) Allow --condor-package to be a logical name, URL (http[s], ftp, gsiftp), 
   or absolute file name.
6) Avoid using globus-url-copy or globus-rls-cli on the remote side unless
   they are really needed. This allows users to specify URLs or file names
   for the Condor package when the remote site doesn't have Globus installed.
7) Add --wait option for create-site and create-glidein. This allows the
   command-line utility to block until the site/glidein reaches a success
   or failed state. This makes scripting the command-line interface easier.
   
KNOWN BUGS
----------
1) The --wait option doesn't work correctly.


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.2
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Implement notifications. Notifications allow asynchronous updates of
   glidein and site state to be sent to clients.
2) Binary worker packages can now be discovered by looking up the package
   name in RLS. The RLS server to use is defined in the jndi.xml file for
   the service.
3) The service will store the EPR for the user's credential instead of the
   credential itself so that the user can update their credential and the
   service will automatically use the new one.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
NONE


===================================
  Release Notes for version 1.0.1
===================================

CHANGES
-------
1) Logical package names should have ".tar.gz" on the end now.
2) Fixed errors when determining host name on remote workers.
3) Normalize all the parameter names across all config files and command-line
   options.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
NONE


===================================
