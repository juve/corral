======================
Installing the service
======================

0. If you don't have a Condor central manager installed and configured, do that now.
   See http://cs.wisc.edu/condor for more help.
   
1. Unzip or get the Corral source from subversion. Put it somewhere like /usr/local/corral.

   Unzip:
   
   $ mv corral-VERSION.tar.gz /usr/local
   $ cd /usr/local
   $ tar xzvf corral-VERSION.tar.gz
   
   Export from Subversion:
   
   $ svn export https://pegasus.isi.edu/svn/corral/tags/VERSION /usr/local/corral
   
   Make sure a normal user owns all the files:
   
   $ chown -R CORRAL_USER:CORRAL_GROUP /usr/local/corral

2. Set your CORRAL_HOME environment variable to point to the directory where 
   you unzipped the source. E.g.:
   
   $ export CORRAL_HOME=/usr/local/corral

3. Make sure ant (> 1.7) and java (> 1.5) are on your path.

4. Compile the source:
 
   $ cd $CORRAL_HOME
   $ ant compile
	
5. Edit the Corral config file: $CORRAL_HOME/etc/config.xml.
       
	5.1 Make sure the Condor configuration points to Condor. The service
		uses a local Condor central manager to submit staging and glidein jobs.
		The paths should be absolute.

6. Add $CORRAL_HOME/bin to your path.

7. If you don't already have one, get a host certificate and install it in
   /etc/grid-security/containercert.pem and /etc/grid-security/containerkey.pem
   You can change these paths by editing the configuration file.
   
8. Start the service by running: $CORRAL_HOME/bin/corral-server
   Note: You cannot run the service as root. Run it as an ordinary user.
   The user should be able to read the host key file.

9. Generate a user proxy. This proxy should be mapped in your grid-mapfile.

10. Test with:

	$ corral ls
	
	You shouldn't get any output (ls lists the sites, but you shouldn't have
	any sites configured yet). If you get an error, then something is wrong with
	your configuration. Usually it is a problem with the certificates.
	
11. Get help:

	$ corral help
	
	Or for a specific command:
	
	$ corral help ls

12. Create a site using the create-site command:

	$ corral cs -af site.args
	
	Use 'corral help cs' for more info.
	
13. Create a glidein using the create-glidein command:

	$ corral cg -s 1 -af glidein.args
	
	Use 'corral help cg' for more info.
