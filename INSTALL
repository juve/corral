INSTALLING THE GLIDEIN GRID SERVICE

1. Set your GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to point to the globus 
   directory where you want to install the service.

2. Make sure ant (> 1.7) and java (> 1.5) are on your path

3. Run:
	$ ant deploy
	
4. Edit $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/glidein_service/jndi-config.xml.

   4.1 Make sure the Database configuration points to a valid MySQL database
   4.2 Make sure the Condor configuration points to Condor

5. Restart your globus container

6. Test with:

	$ glidein help
	$ glidein help ls
	$ glidein ls
	$ glidein ls -authz none

   Note: If you have problems authenticating, make sure your container is set
         up with a valid host certificate. You can look at the output of
         'glidein help ls' to determine what the correct parameters are to
         get the security working correctly. (Hint: 'glidein ls -authz none')
