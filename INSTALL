======================
Installing the service
======================

1. Unzip the source.

2. Set your CORRAL_HOME environment variable to point to the directory where 
   you unzipped the source.

3. Make sure ant (> 1.7) and java (> 1.5) are on your path.

4. Compile the source by running: ant compile
	
5. Edit $CORRAL_HOME/etc/config.xml.
       
	5.1 Make sure the Condor configuration points to Condor. The service
		uses a local Condor central manager to submit staging and glidein jobs.
		The paths should be absolute.
       
	5.2 (Optional) Make sure the Database configuration points to a valid 
		database. The glidein service supports both SQLite and MySQL databases.
		It will automatically install tables if pointed at a valid database
		instance. The default uses SQLite and should not require any
		configuration changes to work.

6. Add $CORRAL_HOME/bin to your path.

7. Start the service by running: $CORRAL_HOME/bin/corral-server

8. Test with:

	corral help
	corral help ls
	corral ls
