OVERVIEW
--------

condor_logstat is a tool that produces a Netlogger log file containing periodic
status information for a Condor pool.

INSTALLATION
------------

The easiest way to install condor_logstat is to add it to the list of Condor
daemons in condor_config for your central manager. Add these:

LOGSTAT = /full/path/to/condor_logstat
LOGSTAT_ARGS = -l /path/to/condor/status.log -i 300 -m 1024
LOGSTAT_LOG = $(LOG)/LogstatLog

Where -l specifies the path to the status log file, -i specifies the logging 
interval in seconds, and -m specifies the max log file size in KB 
(see 'condor_logstat -help'). LOGSTAT_LOG is for error messages.

Finally, add it to the daemon list and restart Condor:

DAEMONS = MASTER, SCHEDD, NEGOTIATOR, COLLECTOR, LOGSTAT

LOG FILE
--------

condor_logstat produces a file with lines such as:

ts=2009-01-28T22:30:31.000Z event=condor.status machine.total=2 machine.owner=0 \
	machine.claimed=0 machine.unclaimed=2 machine.matched=0 machine.backfill=0 \
	machine.preempting=0 job.total=0 job.unexpanded=0 job.idle=0 job.running=0 \
	job.removed=0 job.completed=0 job.held=0
	
This line tells Netlogger how many machines there were in your pool, and how
many of those machines were currently in each state when the snapshot was
taken. It also lists the total number of jobs and the total number of jobs
in each status. Netlogger stores this information and it is mined to produce
useful charts.
